      <description>The Everactive Edge RESTful API gives you direct programmatic access to the data returned by Eversensors. The API provides endpoints to retrieve data based on time ranges, and shortcuts to get the last-available reading from a particular sensor. Typically, applications will poll these endpoints to get the most up-to-date information. In this article, we are going to use Pipedream.com as a mechanism to periodically poll the API for new data and log it in a spreadsheet on Google Docs.</description>

      <description>MQTT is a widely used protocol in the IoT world.Â It is a lightweight pub/sub messaging system, with a small code footprint and minimal bandwidth requirements, which makes it ideal for connecting remote small devices. To implement the MQTT protocol you need a robust broker service to handle the connections and the messages transportation.
RabbitMQ is one of the most popular message brokers in the market. It is easy to deploy and solves all kinds of messaging requirements at small and large scales.</description>
