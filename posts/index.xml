      <description>The Everactive Edge RESTful API gives you direct programmatic access to the data returned by Eversensors. The API provides endpoints to retrieve data based on time ranges, and shortcuts to get the last-available reading from a particular sensor. Typically, applications will poll these endpoints to get the most up-to-date information. In this article, we are going to use Pipedream.com as a mechanism to periodically poll the API for new data and log it in a spreadsheet on Google Docs.</description>

      <description>MQTT is a widely used protocol in the IoT world.Â It is a lightweight pub/sub messaging system, with a small code footprint and minimal bandwidth requirements, which makes it ideal for connecting remote small devices. To implement the MQTT protocol you need a robust broker service to handle the connections and the messages transportation.
RabbitMQ is one of the most popular message brokers in the market. It is easy to deploy and solves all kinds of messaging requirements at small and large scales.</description>

      <description>From the MIT Technology Review:
Artificial Intelligence is creating a new colonial world order.
Big tech is following concerning patterns when deploying their services in developing countries. Just like the colonialists of the past, this companies are extracting value from vulnerable communities for their enrichment. This MIT Technology Review series of articles is a real eye-opener.
 &amp;ldquo;The AI industry does not seek to capture land as the conquistadors of the Caribbean and Latin America did, but the same desire for profit drives it to expand its reach.</description>
