      <description>The jukebox 🔗Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been obsessed with the old way of listening to music. You know: from your own collection, in order, one album at a time. No randomness, no infinite playlists, no album of the day, no ads, and no algorithms. When I got my hands on an Adafruit MacroPad RP2040 I knew what I had to do: make my own ugly and overengineered music player. I present to you the &amp;ldquo;MacroPad Jukebox&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>The challenge 🔗While working with the Everactive Development Kit that I keep at home, I often need to interact with the sensors physically —to test our motion sensor, for example. This of course forces me to have the kit close by, which is inconvenient. I would like to be able to activate the sensors remotely when I am working from the office or my favorite coffee shop.
On the other hand, I have been looking for an excuse to use the Arduino IoT Cloud service.</description>

      <title>Node-RED and the Everactive API - Part 1</title>
      <link>https://carlosolmos.dev/posts/node-red-and-the-everactive-api-part-1/</link>

      <description>Node-RED is a great tool for low-code IoT programming. Its drag &amp;amp; drop interface allows you to wire hardware and software to get data flowing in no time. It&amp;rsquo;s open source and there is plenty of documentation and helpful resources around. In this article -the first of two parts- we are going to create a very simple workflow to fetch data from the Everactive API, and a public data service, and then apply a very simple thresholding function.</description>

      <description>From Everactive&amp;rsquo;s Webhook Subscriptions to Fluentd &amp;amp; S3 🔗 Disclaimer: this solution is totally overengineered. Only for learning purposes. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to use this in production, or do you?&amp;hellip;😜
 Everactive’s Managed Network ensures connectivity, uptime, and reliable &amp;amp; secure data transfer into our Platform. We understand that you need a steady stream of new data to transform into high-value insights to package as innovative, hyper-scale IoT applications to your end users.</description>
