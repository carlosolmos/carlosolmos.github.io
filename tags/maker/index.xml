      <description>The jukebox ðŸ”—Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been obsessed with the old way of listening to music. You know: from your own collection, in order, one album at a time. No randomness, no infinite playlists, no album of the day, no ads, and no algorithms. When I got my hands on an Adafruit MacroPad RP2040 I knew what I had to do: make my own ugly and overengineered music player. I present to you the &amp;ldquo;MacroPad Jukebox&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>The challenge ðŸ”—While working with the Everactive Development Kit that I keep at home, I often need to interact with the sensors physically â€”to test our motion sensor, for example. This of course forces me to have the kit close by, which is inconvenient. I would like to be able to activate the sensors remotely when I am working from the office or my favorite coffee shop.
On the other hand, I have been looking for an excuse to use the Arduino IoT Cloud service.</description>
