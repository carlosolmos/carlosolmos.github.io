      <description>The challenge ðŸ”—While working with the Everactive Development Kit that I keep at home, I often need to interact with the sensors physically â€”to test our motion sensor, for example. This of course forces me to have the kit close by, which is inconvenient. I would like to be able to activate the sensors remotely when I am working from the office or my favorite coffee shop.
On the other hand, I have been looking for an excuse to use the Arduino IoT Cloud service.</description>
