      <title>Abandonware: evaluating the health of the libraries in your project</title>

      <description>Open Source Dependencies ðŸ”—I find it very interesting how comfortable we, software engineers, have become with the notion of including thousands, and thousands, of lines of code we know nothing about in our projects. I don&amp;rsquo;t think reusing open-source libraries is bad. Quite the opposite; I am convinced that software development based on open-source software (OSS) is what allows us to move ahead in the industry at a fast pace.</description>

      <title>Shake It! - Remote sensor activation using the Arduino IoT Cloud</title>

      <description>The challenge ðŸ”—While working with the Everactive Development Kit that I keep at home, I often need to interact with the sensors physically â€”to test our motion sensor, for example. This of course forces me to have the kit close by, which is inconvenient. I would like to be able to activate the sensors remotely when I am working from the office or my favorite coffee shop.
On the other hand, I have been looking for an excuse to use the Arduino IoT Cloud service.</description>

      <title>Node-RED and the Everactive API - Part 1</title>
      <link>https://carlosolmos.dev/posts/node-red-and-the-everactive-api-part-1/</link>

      <description>Node-RED is a great tool for low-code IoT programming. Its drag &amp;amp; drop interface allows you to wire hardware and software to get data flowing in no time. It&amp;rsquo;s open source and there is plenty of documentation and helpful resources around. In this article -the first of two parts- we are going to create a very simple workflow to fetch data from the Everactive API, and a public data service, and then apply a very simple thresholding function.</description>

      <title>Everactive Edge API and Pipedream</title>
      <link>https://carlosolmos.dev/posts/everactive-edge-api-and-pipedream/</link>

      <description>The Everactive Edge RESTful API gives you direct programmatic access to the data returned by Eversensors. The API provides endpoints to retrieve data based on time ranges, and shortcuts to get the last-available reading from a particular sensor. Typically, applications will poll these endpoints to get the most up-to-date information. In this article, we are going to use Pipedream.com as a mechanism to periodically poll the API for new data and log it in a spreadsheet on Google Docs.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What is not defined cannot be measured. What is not measured, cannot be improved. What is not improved, is always degraded&amp;rdquo;. William Thomson Kelvin
 In this article, we will learn how to create custom metrics for a simple web application and use Prometheus to collect and report on them.
Site Reliability Engineering ðŸ”—This post is part of a series about Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). In the series, we will talk about different concepts,Â tools, and techniques to keep a large-scale system healthy.</description>

      <title>MQTT with RabbitMQ</title>
      <link>https://carlosolmos.dev/posts/mqtt-with-rabbitmq/</link>

      <description>MQTT is a widely used protocol in the IoT world.Â It is a lightweight pub/sub messaging system, with a small code footprint and minimal bandwidth requirements, which makes it ideal for connecting remote small devices. To implement the MQTT protocol you need a robust broker service to handle the connections and the messages transportation.
RabbitMQ is one of the most popular message brokers in the market. It is easy to deploy and solves all kinds of messaging requirements at small and large scales.</description>

      <description>From the MIT Technology Review:
Artificial Intelligence is creating a new colonial world order.
Big tech is following concerning patterns when deploying their services in developing countries. Just like the colonialists of the past, this companies are extracting value from vulnerable communities for their enrichment. This MIT Technology Review series of articles is a real eye-opener.
 &amp;ldquo;The AI industry does not seek to capture land as the conquistadors of the Caribbean and Latin America did, but the same desire for profit drives it to expand its reach.</description>
